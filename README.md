> Config and CSS styles used with CTFd's core-beta theme for Fall CTF 2022

For Fall CTF 2022, we used CTFd as our backend along with CTFd's [core-beta](https://github.com/CTFd/core-beta) theme.

1. Import the core-beta theme into CTFd
2. In CTFd admin settings, go to Config > Theme.
3. Set the theme to "core-beta" and copy each of the files in this repo into the text fields
  - [Theme Header](https://github.com/sigpwny/fallctf-2022-core-beta-config/blob/main/theme-header.txt)
  - [Theme Footer](https://github.com/sigpwny/fallctf-2022-core-beta-config/blob/main/theme-footer.txt)
  - [Theme Settings](https://github.com/sigpwny/fallctf-2022-core-beta-config/blob/main/theme-settings.txt)

There are 5 difficulty tags (`'beginner', 'easy', 'medium', 'hard', 'extreme'`). Simply add a difficulty tag on a CTFd challenge to get a fancy badge on the challenge page.
